# 🧠 Recursion & Iteration Practice — Fibonacci & Merge Sort

This repository contains two small JavaScript programs designed to strengthen your understanding of **iteration**, **recursion**, and **divide-and-conquer algorithms**.  
You’ll implement and test both **Fibonacci sequence** generators and a **recursive Merge Sort**.

---

## ⚙️ Implementations
- ➤ fibs(n) — Iterative
Uses a simple loop to build the Fibonacci sequence step by step.

- ➤ fibsRec(n) — Recursive
Solves the same problem recursively.
A console.log("This was printed recursively"); line is added at the start of the function to visualize recursion depth.
